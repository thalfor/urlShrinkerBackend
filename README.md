# Url Shortner Backend

here i developed the application backend using:
- Fastify
- @fastify/cors
- dotenv
- zod
- knex
- sqlite3
- nanoid

## Fastify / cors

I chose Fastify for i think it is better maintained than express. I'm currently coursing a Node.js Expert course and was introduced to Fastify just recently, but i already like it.
