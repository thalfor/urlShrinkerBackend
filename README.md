# Url Shortner Backend

here i developed the application backend using:
- Fastify
- @fastify/cors
- dotenv
- zod
- knex
- sqlite3
- nanoid

## Fastify / cors

I chose Fastify for i think it is better maintained than express. I'm currently coursing a Node.js Expert course and was introduced to Fastify just recently, but i already like it.

## dotenv / knex / sqlite3

i honestly think they're insanely comon so i won't be going into details here.

## zod

This is a great application to pre define some inputs, since JS doesn't accepts basically everything this tool actually makes it pre-defined and well documented.

## nanoid

Tool for create a small id the size that you want. Simple to use.
